This is a record of current goals and progress for this project.
please feel free to add what you have worked on and what you would we should do next.


step 1 basic setup:
	create the window and basic runtime environment for the game.
	

step 2 basic object creation
	1. draw objects
	2. basic physics



general Ideas for game: any ideas and brainstorming goes here.
	1. Permadeath
	2. 32-bit Platforming
	3. Procedurally generated content (design ~200 layouts)
	4. Have only around 10 enemies who get generated with stats corresponding to the level 
		of the dungeon you are at (out of 50)
	5. Enemies and traps get harder as you go on; gear also scales.
	6. Boss design that isn't crappy - must rely on skill only.
	7. Get someone else to do the art, that's not our deal, LOL.
