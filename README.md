/*
~Entry 1 (1/7/14)~
This is going to be a sort of weird platformer that's geared toward making it to the top of a deep dungeon.


At the end, you will face Mosaka, the guardian of the dungeon, and you will try to fight for your freedom. 
If you fail at any time during the game, it's permadeath, so there it is. :D

I hope to finish this before I go to college, but you never know - things could come up.
